Hey everyone, i'm back again with another project from CodeCademy, this time around in what they refer to as an Off-Platform Project.

For this project I was tasked with designg a webpage from the ground up, which I will admit was tough.

At first I didn't have much of a clue where to begin in terms of coding in spite of the lesson's learned up to this point, but I took it step by step and managed to figure it out with some online help of course, and in the end I feel very happy about what I mangaed to accomplished.
